## 🎯 **USAGE EXAMPLES**

### Frontend Integration

```javascript
// Payment Processing Flow
const processPayment = async (orderId, amount) => {
  // 1. Create payment order
  const orderResponse = await fetch("/api/payments/create-order", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ orderId, amount }),
  });

  // 2. For demo, use mock success endpoint
  const paymentResponse = await fetch("/api/payments/mock-success", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ orderId }),
  });

  const result = await paymentResponse.json();

  if (result.success) {
    console.log("Payment successful!");
    console.log("Invoice generated:", result.data.invoice.invoiceNumber);
    console.log("Email sent:", result.data.invoice.emailSent);
  }
};
```

### Invoice Download

```javascript
const downloadInvoice = async (invoiceId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/payments/invoice/${invoiceId}/download`, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
  });

  const blob = await response.blob();
  const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  const a = document.createElement("a");
  a.href = url;
  a.download = `invoice-${invoiceId}.pdf`;
  a.click();
};
```
